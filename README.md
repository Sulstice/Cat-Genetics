# Cat Genetic Algorithm

This is an incomplete implementation of a cat generic algorithm based on real world examples.

This code is basically just a little training piece for me to get started with Python.

## Right now it supports the following phenotypes:

- gender/sex
- black and red
- agouti and non-agouti
- point colouring and solid colouring
- dilluted colors or non-diluted
- fur length

It understands that certain color combinations have a new name/term. (For example agouti + tortoiseshell becomes "torbie".)

It also understands that certain color combinations are not valid (unless a mutation or gene defect occurs).

## Functionality:

When running the code it will read the genetic markup of the parent and turn the output into valid phenotypes.

### Further plans:

I want to support more than just the above phenotypes and also at some point add a visual representation of the cats that are put out. I am not actively working on it at the moment but will come back to it eventually.

Code is messy and still a working/experimenting sheet.
